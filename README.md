## CS225 Final Project - MTD Shortest Path
By Tina Banthia, Arnav Shah, Madhu Vakkadala

## How To Run 
Copy this line `https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa21/tinajb2-mv16-arnavss2.git` into terminal to download our project. 

Now, cd into this repository and run 
```
$ make
$ ./main
```
in terminal to start the program. You will be prompted to enter two bus stops - the start and end points of your trip. This will return the shortest list of all the stops you would pass through to reach your destination depending on whether it uses BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.
You can also view our visual representation of all the MTD stops in the `map.png` file. 

To run tests, cd into the `tests` folder, and enter 
```
$ make test
$ ./test
```
in terminal to run all the tests created.

The data we used was taken from the https://developer.cumtd.com website.
